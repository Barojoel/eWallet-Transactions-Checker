# eWallet-Transactions-Checker

#The objective of this assignment, is to create a simple money tracker for users. Money can be tracked in multiple wallets (accounts), for example, if a user has multiple businesses. When a user's profile is pulled up, it should show a overall balance and all their wallets (accounts) and their respective balances. Drilling down into each wallet (account), should show the detailed transactions of that wallet (account).  
# Used post man to test API connections and push data to the mongoDB.
